My cool dotfiles
================

Don't use the installation script, it's for my personal use (and it's really not ready at all).

My whole desktop and environment uses the [spaceduck](https://github.com/pineapplegiant/spaceduck) color scheme. It's nice on they eyes, pretty dark, and I like the contrast it gives for both code and env.
